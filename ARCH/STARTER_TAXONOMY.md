# Insight 5 — Starter Taxonomy (Fixed List v1)

This is the initial “fixed starter list” for `category` + `subcategory`.

Rules:
- Users can still type new values (freeform), but the UI should **suggest** from this list first.
- When a new value is used repeatedly, it should be promoted into suggestions (bidirectional).
