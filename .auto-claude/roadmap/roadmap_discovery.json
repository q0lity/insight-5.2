    "pain_points": [
      "Traditional journaling and tracking apps require too much manual data entry",
      "Punitive gamification (like Habitica) causes shame spirals for ADHD users",
      "Data is scattered across multiple apps without unified insights",
      "Voice apps don't understand context or produce structured data",
      "Difficulty correlating mood/energy patterns with activities"

      "Capture life events, tasks, habits, and trackers primarily via voice",

    "value_proposition": "Voice-first capture with AI parsing turns 30-second voice notes into structured events, tasks, habits, and trackers. Non-punitive XP gamification rewards without punishment. Local-first architecture ensures data ownership and offline reliability. Unified data model makes everything queryable.",

      "Capture latency under 5 seconds (online)",
      "100% offline capture reliability",
