  "task_description": "I want you to take this UI as kinda inspiration for the app because, like, I don't want you to make, like, over sweeping changes, but, I want you to kind of, like, this is kinda how I wish the UI looked if I was being honest, like, you know, on the mobile and on the app and, like, you know, the like, this is what the dark mode looked like and, like, all this kind of stuff. So how would you how would you modulate the UI to, kinda do this? So as you'll see in the picture, So as you'll see in the picture, like, when you do the, you know, the UI modification, I want you to add all these, like, small little components here. So, like, when I have my main screen and I'm saying I'm doing something right now, for example, So I kinda want you to, like, you know, make this, like, you know, hey. If there's subtasks involved in me doing my shit that, you know, it's it, like, fills it out kinda like that taskbar because Yeah. Because, I need that, like, information. So you need to, like, kinda compact it to, you know, like, that active session. I I don't know. You can, like, rework it so that it follows the logic of the pictures that I'm showing you. And then the other thing is I want the UI to look like the picture that I'm giving you. So I want you to apply those, like, themes, components, like, you know, text, all that kind of stuff. So this looks very, very clean. Okay? So that's gonna be a really, really, really big refactor. So I need you to do full research on the UI. Everything still needs to work. That's the criteria. You need to run tests. I still want all the same features, but I want you to redesign the UI with, like, this picture in mind because I like this a lot better. Okay? Like, you know, this is this should be the dark mode. You know, there should still be the warm mode, but then if I do the warm mode, it should be light. And the components that you have in here are the ones of the UI that I really want you to look at. So here we go. I'm gonna try and put some references in here for you as well. It's gonna apply both to the web app and the mobile app. Okay? This is the main page. I need you to adapt it, and, I'm gonna give you some of the elements here.",
