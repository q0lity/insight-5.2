      "proposed_change": "1) Audit all interactive elements for minimum 44x44px clickable area. 2) For visual elements that need to appear smaller, use padding to expand the touch target while keeping visual size compact. 3) Add a new CSS utility class for ensuring minimum touch targets. 4) Apply to chip close buttons, small toggles, and inline action buttons.",
