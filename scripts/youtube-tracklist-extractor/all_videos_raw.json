    "description": "A promotional mix of my Album \"Inner Words\" Out on Timewarp Records 11-04-2025.  @Geomagnetic\u202c \u202a@GeomagneticRecords\u202c \nhttps://www.beatport.com/release/inner-worlds/5030009\n\n#psychedelictrance #goatrance #live #psytrancemix  #goaparty #psytrancefamily #psytrancepeople #psytrancefestivals #psytrancecommunity \n\nSETI Project by Guido Venier  is a legendary Acid-Goa-Trance project from the 90s.\nThe journey of SETI Project into Trance music began in the late 1990ies and is about to continue into the future. Heavily inspired by Astral Projection, Tsujoshi Suzuki and Logic Bomb, to name a few, Guido creates a unique blend of Psy- and Goatrance with a touch of Acid Techno heavily rooted in classic Goa music but also looking ahead. The name of the project is derived from the equivocal scientific project dedicated to the search of intelligent alien life.\n\nFor booking mail to: guido@seti-project.com\n\nSocial links\nhttps://linktr.ee/setiproject\n \nSetlist: \n01. 00:00:00 SETI Project - Reality \n02. 00:07:44 SETI Project - Mescaline \n03. 00:14:07 SETI Project - Forty Two\n04 00:20:57 SETI Project - DMT Entities\n05. 00:27:34 SETI Project - Magnetar\n06. 00:33:45 SETI Project - Driven To Madness\n07. 00:39:50 SETI Project - Fear And Loathing \n08. 00:47:03 SETI Project - Mutagene\n09. 00:52:47 SETI Project - Boom Shankar\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SETIProject\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSuLz6rhqj3BsDKLQ1fQlQ/videos\nhttps://www.facebook.com/seti.project/\nhttps://www.inhttps://www.instagram.com/setiprojectde/stagram.com/setiprojectde/",

    "description": "A promotional mix of my Album \"Space Walk\" Out on @SuntripRecords\u202c\nget your copy at https://www.beatport.com/release/space-walk/4572565\n\nSETI Project by Guido Venier  is a legendary Acid-Goa-Trance project from the 90s.\nThe journey of SETI Project into Trance music began in the late 1990ies and is about to continue into the future. Heavily inspired by Astral Projection, Tsujoshi Suzuki and Logic Bomb, to name a few, Guido creates a unique blend of Psy- and Goatrance with a touch of Acid Techno heavily rooted in classic Goa music but also looking ahead. The name of the project is derived from the equivocal scientific project dedicated to the search of intelligent alien life.\n\nFor booking mail to: guido@seti-project.com\n\nSocial links\nhttps://linktr.ee/setiproject\n \nSetlist: \n01. 00:00:00 Sirius\n02. 00:08:10 Dance Temple\n03. 00:15:13 Medusa\n04. 00:23:44 Acid Monastery\n05. 00:30:53 Mr. Spock\n06. 00:37:37 Spacewalk\n07. 00:44:42 Bubble Bobble\n08. 00:53:18 Breathe\n\n\n#psychedelictrance #goatrance #live #psytrancemix  #goaparty #psytrancefamily #psytrancepeople #psytrancefestivals #psytrancecommunity",

    "description": "Alienatic is a fast-rising psychedelic trance project from Holland, led by Jake van Aarst, also known as Jakaan. Jake has been involved in the psytrance scene for many years, both as a DJ and as a producer of his progressive psytrance project, Jakaan.\nAlienatic's style is characterized by its uptempo, full-on beats, funky baselines, dreamy atmospheres, and unique, otherworldly sounds that give it a distinct, alien-like quality. The project quickly gained popularity, with its tracks and remixes being well-received by fans of the genre.\nIn 2020, Alienatic signed with the prestigious UK-based label Nano Records, which has helped to further propel the project's success. With collaborations with some of the biggest names in the industry, such as Killerwatts, Ital, and Ajja, Alienatic is poised for continued success in the world of psychedelic trance.\nSo, for those who love the full-on, uptempo style of psychedelic trance, Alienatic is definitely a project to keep an eye on!
