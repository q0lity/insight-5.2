## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**STATUS: ALL PROPOSED EDITS APPROVED**

No conflicts detected with core constraints:
- ✓ No client LLM keys mentioned or implied
- ✓ Offline capture explicitly preserves raw data  
- ✓ Segments stored in DB with timestamp offsets maintained
- ✓ Markdown export stability preserved through server-side processing
- ✓ Human-editable format maintained via simple text markers

The proposed edits strengthen constraint compliance, particularly A6.2's explicit prohibition of client-side LLM processing.

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH ALL PROPOSED EDITS AS WRITTEN**
