You are Agent P (PRD update). Use ONLY the context below. Task: propose concise edits to MASTER_PRD_V3.md to reflect:
1) Web UI is the source of truth; desktop/web UI should not change fundamentally.
2) Mobile UI must adapt to match all web features; mobile capture UX is highest priority.
3) During capture, the app writes markdown live; for simple commands it logs a minimal event; for multi-topic capture it inserts dividers/segments in the live markdown.

Context excerpt (MASTER_PRD_V3):
- Section 5: Language: Markdown + YAML + Tokens. Notes stored as timestamped segments/dividers.
- Section 6: Voice + MCP-Style Command Interface.
- Section 7: Screens & Navigation (Dashboard, Voice Log Screen, Review Cards, Calendar, etc.).
- Section 16: Detailed User Flows (Quick Log).

Deliverable:
- Provide exact insertion points by section heading and propose the new text (short bullet additions).
- Keep it consistent with existing tone and constraints (ASCII only).
