# Tasks

## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Parser/linker v2: category memory, direct category prompt, purchase/consume split, tracker/context guardrails, dedupe.
- [ ] 1.2 Review UX: auto-created tasks preselected with opt-out; category prompt flow wired.
- [ ] 1.3 Tasks table: column picker (persist across devices), start button, subtasks timeline, unscheduled all-day lane.
- [ ] 1.4 Goals plan: outline + Gantt split panel, milestones + dependencies, unlink on goal removal.
- [ ] 1.5 Habits/trackers: routine mapping, auto-check rules, consistency mini graph, guardrails.
- [ ] 1.6 Calendar: read-only locked events, all-day lane layout, auto-start onboarding default.
- [ ] 1.7 Countdown badges across surfaces (tasks/events/goals/milestones).

## 2. Verification
- [ ] 2.1 Add/adjust tests for parser/linker, dedupe, and countdown badges where applicable.
