# Spec Deltas — 5-3-refactor

## Parsing + Categorization
- Direct category prompt on low confidence with preselected suggestion.
- Category memory + synonym normalization (global).
- Purchase vs consume split; tracker/context guardrails.
- Dedupe rules prevent duplicate blocks/tables.

## Tasks + Goals
- Tasks table: column picker (persist across devices), start button, subtasks timeline.
- Unscheduled tasks surface in all-day lane for drag scheduling.
- Goals plan: outline + Gantt split panel, milestones + dependencies.

## Calendar + Sync
- All-day lane holds all-day events and unscheduled tasks.
- Read-only calendars render locked events; no outbound sync.
- Auto-start default configured in onboarding.

## Global UI
- Countdown badges appear anywhere a target date exists.
