# Agent 03 — UI/UX System (Beauty + Interactivity)

## Deliverables
- `Insight 5/DESIGN/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (typography, spacing, color, motion)
- `Insight 5/DESIGN/NAVIGATION.md` (left bar / underbar / right bar layout)
- `Insight 5/DESIGN/CARDS_AND_GESTURES.md` (review cards, swipes, confirmations)

## Must Support (MVP)
- Dashboard, Calendar, Habits, Fitness, Nutrition, Timeline, Views, Entry detail
- Fast capture (one-tap mic, Action Button entry)
- Calm “Obsidian-like” density without feeling cluttered

## Markdown Notes + Outline (Voice Capture)
Plugin evidence reviewed:
- `plugins/journaling/manifest.json` (journal-style continuous daily notes + outline flow)
- `plugins/obsidian-memos/manifest.json` (capture into daily notes)
- `plugins/obsidian-tasks-plugin/manifest.json` (checklists + subtasks inside notes)
- `plugins/obsidian-day-planner/manifest.json` (day planner layout + live time indicator)

UI guidance:
- Markdown preview supports nested checklist items with collapsible subtrees.
- Collapsible controls live on the left edge of each list item.
- Checklist actions (checkbox + start timer) align to the right for fast thumb targeting.
- Dense spacing: tighter line-height/margins for long-form transcript outlines.
- Active events render from their true start to the live “now” line in day view.
