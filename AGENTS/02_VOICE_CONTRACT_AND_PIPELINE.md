# Agent 02 — Voice Contract & Pipeline

## Deliverables
- `Insight 5/ARCH/VOICE_CONTRACT_V1.md` (JSON schema + examples)
- `Insight 5/ARCH/VOICE_RULEBOOK.md` (deterministic rules + fallbacks)

## Must Support (MVP)
- Multi-entry utterances (one transcript → multiple proposals)
- Active event context (append notes vs new entry)
- Token extraction (`#tracker(7)`, `+context`, `@person`)
- Workout/nutrition templates
- “Suggested task” vs “auto-create task” threshold

## Confirmation UX
- Swipe to accept/reject
- Tap to edit fields
- Batch apply
